# AzureML-Recommender-Files


The word document is an AzureML training document which shows step-by-step how to create
a Recommender system and then call Azure via an API from a live webpage.

The files are supplemental files - separate from the Azure ML experiment that you will 
create in your own Azure environment - which help in the latter portions of the training.

The word document's introduction shows system flows and a snapshot of expected results.
